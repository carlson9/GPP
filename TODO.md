* write a generalized function for plotting results
* write a function that will create the Stan code
* write a function that runs the Stan code and checks the model for convergence
* write a function that checks coverage of placebos
* write a wrapper to the above functions that updates noise until convergence
* write a super wrapper that does it all
* document as writing, and add sub-tasks to this list
